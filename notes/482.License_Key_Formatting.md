# License Key Formatting

## 题目

You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

Output: "2-5G-3J"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```

**Note:**

1. The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.
2. String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).
3. String S is non-empty.

## 解题思路

第一思路是先分割数组来计算非`-`字符数量。AC 以后再改成了不分割计算。Run Time 21ms，打败 75.50% 的 Java 解法。

## 最佳解法

基本一样的思路，只是做了一个倒置处理，代码非常简洁：

```java
public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        if (s.charAt(i) != '-')
            sb.append(sb.length() % (k + 1) == k ? '-' : "").append(s.charAt(i));
    return sb.reverse().toString().toUpperCase();
} 
```

## 其他解法

原来 StringBuilder 还有一个`insert`方法：

```java
public class Solution {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String S, int K) {
        // Replacing all - and converting all letters to uppercase
        String S1 = S.replace("-","");
        S1 = S1.toUpperCase();
        
        // Making stringBuilder 
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
         for(int i=0; i<S1.length();i++) {
            sb.append(S1.charAt(i));
        }
        int len = sb.toString().length();
        // Inserting '-' from back at every K position
        for(int i=K; i < len; i=i+K) {
                sb.insert(len-i,'-');
            }
        return sb.toString();   
    }
}
```
