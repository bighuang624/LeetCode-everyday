# Range Addition II

## 题目

Given an m * n matrix **M** initialized with all 0's and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers **a** and **b**, which means **M[i][j]** should be **added by one** for all **0 <= i < a** and **0 <= j < b**.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

Example 1:

```
Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
```

**Note:**

* The range of m and n is [1,40000].
* The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
* The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.

## 解题思路

直接用二维数组存储和计算会导致空间耗尽。考虑到每次都是从 0 坐标开始，即左上角一块，比较容易想到最小的一块区域是最终数最大的一块。代码如下：

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        int minHeight = m;
        int minWidth = n;
        for(int[] arr : ops) {
            minHeight = Math.min(minHeight, arr[0]);
            minWidth = Math.min(minWidth, arr[1]);
        }
        return minHeight * minWidth;
    }
}
```
