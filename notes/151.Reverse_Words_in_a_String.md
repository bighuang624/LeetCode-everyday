# Reverse Words in a String

## 题目

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Example:**

```
Input: "the sky is blue",
Output: "blue is sky the".
```

**Note:**

* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Follow up:** For C programmers, try to solve it in-place in O(1) space.

## 解题思路

用`trim`去除句子前后空格，用`split`切割。代码如下：

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        String[] words = s.split(" +");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            sb.append(words[words.length-1-i]);
            if(i != words.length-1)
                sb.append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
