# Maximize Distance to Closest Person

## 题目

In a row of `seats`, `1` represents a person sitting in that seat, and `0` represents that the seat is empty. 

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to closest person.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= seats.length <= 20000`
2. `seats` contains only 0s or 1s, at least one `0`, and at least one `1`.

## 解题思路

从前向后遍历一次，从后向前遍历一次，用一个与`seats`等长的数组记录该位置的`maximum distance`。代码如下：

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
        int n = seats.length;
        int[] dis = new int[n];
        int prev = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n && prev == -1; i++) {
            dis[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            if(seats[i] == 1) {
                prev = i;
                dis[i] = 0;
            }
        }  
        for(int i = prev; i < n; i++) {
            if(seats[i] == 1) {
                prev = i;
                dis[i] = 0;
            }
            else 
                dis[i] = i - prev;
        }
        int result = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int i = n-1; i >= prev; i--) 
            result = Math.max(result, dis[i]);
        for(int i = prev-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if(seats[i] == 1)
                prev = i;
            else
                dis[i] = Math.min(dis[i], prev - i);
            result = Math.max(result, dis[i]);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
