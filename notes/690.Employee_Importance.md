# Employee Importance

## 题目

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's **unique id**, his **importance value** and his **direct** subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is **not direct**.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

**Note:**

1. One employee has at most one **direct** leader and may have several subordinates.
2. The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

## 解题思路

注意，属下的价值还要通过计算他本身的价值和他的属下的总价值得到。

自己第一次 AC 的代码如下：

```java
class Solution {
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        Employee boss = getBoss(employees, id);
        int value = boss.importance;
        List<Integer> sub = boss.subordinates;
        for(int newId : sub)
            value += getImportance(employees, newId);
        return value;
    }
    
    private Employee getBoss(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        for(Employee em : employees) 
            if(em.id == id) 
                return em;
        return null;
    }
}
```

Run Time 35 ms。估计是因为搜查的方法效率太低。

## 优化思路

改变搜查方法。一开始创建一个以雇员 id 为 key、雇员实例为 value 的 HashMap，之后在 map 中按照 id 查找即可。代码如下：

```java
class Solution {
    Map<Integer, Employee> map = new HashMap<Integer, Employee>();
    
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {  
        for(Employee em : employees)
            map.put(em.id, em);
        return getResult(id);
    }
    
    private int getResult(int id) {
        Employee boss = map.get(id);
        int value = boss.importance;
        for(int newId : boss.subordinates)
            value += getResult(newId);
        return value;
    }
}
```

Run Time 降到 14ms。
