# Rotated Digits

## 题目

X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number `N`, how many numbers X from `1` to `N` are good?

```
Example:
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: 
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
```

**Note:**

* N  will be in range `[1, 10000]`.

## 解题思路

如果一个数是 good，其不能出现 3、4、7 且必须含有 2/5/6/9。代码如下：

```java
class Solution {
    public int rotatedDigits(int N) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
            if(isRotatedDigit(i))
                result++;
        return result;
    }
    
    public boolean isRotatedDigit(int n) {
        boolean has2569 = false;
        while(n != 0) {
            int i = n % 10;
            if(i == 2 || i == 5 || i == 6 || i == 9)
                has2569 = true;
            else if(i == 3 || i == 4 || i == 7)
                return false;
            n = n / 10;
        }
        return has2569;
    }
}
```
