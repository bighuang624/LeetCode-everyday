# Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

## 题目

The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

## 解题思路

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e.Name AS Employee FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.ManagerId IS NOT NULL AND e.Salary > (SELECT Salary FROM Employee WHERE Id = e.ManagerId)
```
上面是我的做法。用了子查询。

Discuss 提供的方案还有：

```sql
SELECT employer.Name
    FROM  Employee employer JOIN Employee manager ON (employer.ManagerId = manager.Id )
      WHERE employer.Salary > manager.Salary ;
```

```sql
select E1.Name 
from Employee as E1, Employee as E2 
where E1.ManagerId = E2.Id and E1.Salary > E2.Salary
```
