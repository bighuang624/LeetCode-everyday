# Complex Number Multiplication

## 题目

Given two strings representing two complex numbers.

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i**2 = -1 according to the definition.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
Output: "0+2i"
Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i**2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
Output: "0+-2i"
Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i**2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.
```

**Note:**

1. The input strings will not have extra blank.
2. The input strings will be given in the form of **a+bi**, where the integer **a** and **b** will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And **the output should be also in this form**.

用`split()`分割再进行处理。
