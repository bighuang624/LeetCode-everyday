# 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

## 题目

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit `0`. The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```

**Note:**
`1 <= len(bits) <= 1000`.
`bits[i]` is always `0` or `1`.

## 解题思路

不算最后一个，用 for 循环遍历。每次遇到 1 时 i++，之后判断 i 是否越界，是的话返回 false。

## 其他方案

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int n = bits.length, i = 0;
        while (i < n - 1) {
            if (bits[i] == 0) i++;
            else i += 2;
        }
        return i == n - 1;
    }
}
```

这个解法需要做的判断数应该要少一些。
