# Longest Palindrome

## 题目

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Note:**
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

**Example:**

```
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

## 解题思路

没啥好说的。出现次数若为偶数全加上，第一次出现的奇数加上，其他的奇数减一。
