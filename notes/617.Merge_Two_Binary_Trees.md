# Merge Two Binary Trees

## 题目

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
```

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

## 解题思路

先试探性地加上

```java
if(t1 == null)
    return t2;
if(t2 == null)
    return t1;
```

后，立即想到就是同时遍历两个树就行，对每次遍历处在同一位置的两个结点，有一个为`null`时返回另一个结点即可，正好与前面这段代码相同。那么剩下的就是每次`new`一个结点为两结点的值的和，然后递归调用自身。代码如下：

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if(t1 == null)
            return t2;
        if(t2 == null)
            return t1;
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(t1.val + t2.val);
        root.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
        root.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
        return root;
    } 
}
```
