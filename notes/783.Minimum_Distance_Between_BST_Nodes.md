# Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

## 题目

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node `root`, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

**Example :**

```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
```

**Note:**

1. The size of the BST will be between 2 and `100`.
2. The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.

## 解题思路

第一思路是中序遍历，用 ArrayList 存储遍历结果，再在其上做一次遍历。之后想到只需要存储前一个结点的值就行。代码如下：

```java
class Solution {
    
    int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    Integer preVal = null;
    
    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        DFS(root);
        return minDiff;
    }
    
    public void DFS(TreeNode root) {
        if(root != null) {
            DFS(root.left);
            if(preVal != null)
                minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, root.val - preVal);
            preVal = root.val;
            DFS(root.right);
        }
    }
}
```
