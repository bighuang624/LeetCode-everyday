# Judge Route Circle

## 题目

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to **the original place**.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are `R` (Right), `L` (Left), `U` (Up) and `D` (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

## 解题思路

没啥好说的。直接用两个 int 类型变量来存储，比开辟一个 int 数组的开销稍微小一点（废话）。
