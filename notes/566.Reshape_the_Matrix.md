# Reshape the Matrix

## 题目

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two **positive** integers **r** and **c** representing the **row** number and **column** number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same **row-traversing** order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:
There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
```

**Note:**

1. The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
2. The given r and c are all positive.

## 解题思路

可以通过余数和除数而非多层循环或条件判断来找索引：

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {
        int height = nums.length;
        int length = nums[0].length;
        if(r * c != height * length)
            return nums;
        int[][] result = new int[r][c];
        for(int i = 0; i < height * length; i++)
            result[i/c][i%c] = nums[i/length][i%length];
        return result;
    }
}
```
