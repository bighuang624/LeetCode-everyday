# Brick Wall

## 题目

There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the **top** to the **bottom** and cross the **least** bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.

**You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.**

**Example:**

```
Input: 
[[1,2,2,1],
 [3,1,2],
 [1,3,2],
 [2,4],
 [3,1,2],
 [1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Explanation:** ![](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/brick_wall.png)

**Note:**

1. The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
2. The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.

## 解题思路

要知道在哪个地方切一刀断的砖块最少，即求哪个地方砖块边缘最多。用一个 HashMap 来记录这些砖块边缘的横坐标。

```java
class Solution {
    public int leastBricks(List<List<Integer>> wall) {
        if(wall == null || wall.size() == 0)
            return 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        for(List<Integer> list : wall) {
            int i = 0;
            for(int j = 0; j < list.size()-1; j++) {
                i += list.get(j);
                map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0)+1);
            }
        }
        int max = 0;
        for(int key : map.keySet())
            max = Math.max(max, map.get(key));
        return wall.size()-max;
    }
}
```
