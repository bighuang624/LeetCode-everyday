# Guess Number Higher or Lower II

## 题目

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

**Example:**

```
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
```

Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

## 解题思路

用动态规划解决。显然，我们需要一个二维数组来记录`start`到`end`之间的状态。其他的都很好理解，部分点写在代码的注释中了：

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] table = new int[n+1][n+1];
        return DP(table, 1, n);
    }
    
    public int DP(int[][] table, int start, int end) {
        if(start >= end)
            return 0;
        if(table[start][end] != 0)
            return table[start][end];
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            // 取最坏状态，来保证一定能赢
            int sum = i + Math.max(DP(table, i+1, end), DP(table, start, i-1));
            // 取最少的钱，来选择最好策略
            res = Math.min(sum, res);
        }
        table[start][end] = res;
        return res;
    }
}
```
