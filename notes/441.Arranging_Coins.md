# Arranging Coins 

## 题目

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

## 解题经历

第一思路很简单，等差数列求和比呗。

贴一个 Discuss 上的 O(1) 算法：

```java
public class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        return (int)((-1 + Math.sqrt(1 + 8 * (long)n)) / 2);
    }
}
```

因为 sum = (x + 1) * x / 2，所以解方程得 x = (-1 + sqrt(8 * n + 1)) / 2。果然算法是数学游戏...
