# Distribute Candies

## 题目

Given an integer array with **even** length, where different numbers in this array represent different **kinds** of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies **equally** in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of **kinds** of candies the sister could gain.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. 
The sister has three different kinds of candies. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: candies = [1,1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1]. 
The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies. 
```

**Note:**

1. The length of the given array is in range [2, 10,000], and will be even.
2. The number in given array is in range [-100,000, 100,000].

## 解题思路

申清题意可知，该题求数组中不重复元素个数 n，若该个数小于数组元素个数的一半 m 则返回 n，否则返回 m。

第一思路是通过排序来求不重复元素的个数。

## 最佳解法

实际上，用 Java 的 Set（HashSet）来获得不重复元素是更好的方法：

```java
public class Solution {
    public int distributeCandies(int[] candies) {
        Set<Integer> kinds = new HashSet<>();
        for (int candy : candies) kinds.add(candy);
        return kinds.size() >= candies.length / 2 ? candies.length / 2 : kinds.size();
    }
}
```

别的语言也有类似的数据结构，不过我平时用的比较少，忘记了...
