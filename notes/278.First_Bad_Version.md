# First Bad Version

## 题目

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API. 

## 解题思路

二分搜索，对接口的使用的复杂度为 O(lgN)。

## 最佳解法

同是二分搜索，Discuss 里的方法显得稍微简洁一些：

```java
public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
    int start = 1, end = n;
    while (start < end) {
        int mid = start + (end-start) / 2;
        if (!isBadVersion(mid)) start = mid + 1;
        else end = mid;            
    }        
    return start;
}
```

## 注意点

`(low + high) / 2`和`low + (high - low) / 2`有区别。如果声明为 int 类型，前一种中`(low + high)`可能超过 int 类型的最大值，导致 Time limit exceed。因此，**要记得使用`low + (high - low) / 2`**。
