# Bulb Switcher

## 题目

There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the i-th round, you toggle every i bulb. For the n-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.
```

## 解题思路

第一思路自然是用数组存储后两个嵌套循环来处理，结果也不负众望地报了超时。

比较容易想到有个数个因子的灯号对应的灯最后是亮的，其他是关的。因此本质上计算 1 - n 中有多少个平方数。那么代码本质上就只有一行了：

```java
class Solution {
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return (int)Math.sqrt(n);
    }
}
```
