# Jewels and Stones

## 题目

You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  

Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

1. `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
2. The characters in `J` are distinct.

## 解题思路

一个 HashSet 解决：

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<Character>();
        for(char ch : J.toCharArray())
            set.add(ch);
        int result = 0;
        for(char ch : S.toCharArray())
            if(set.contains(ch))
                result++;
        return result;
    }
}
```
