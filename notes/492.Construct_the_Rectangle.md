# Construct the Rectangle

## 题目

For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

```
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
```

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

**Example:**

```
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
```

**Note:**

1. The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
2. The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.


## 解题思路

先给面积开方。这时因为要做一个 double 到 int 的类型变换，可能会取整，所以最好将这个值先赋给 width（我的第一版代码赋给了 length，然后就要多做好多判断），然后一个 while 循环缩小 width 直到为面积的因数为止。
