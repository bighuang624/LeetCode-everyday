# Customers Who Never Order

## 题目

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the `Customers` table and the `Orders` table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: `Customers`.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```

Table: `Orders`.

```
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

```
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```

## 解题思路

```sql
SELECT Name AS Customers FROM Customers
      WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders)
```

嘛，数据库还是很重要的对吧...
