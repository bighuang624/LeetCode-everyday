# Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

## 题目

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their **common interest** with the **least list index sum**. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```

**Note:**

1. The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
2. The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
3. The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
4. No duplicates in both lists.


## 解题思路

拿 Map 来存储，字符串做 key，索引作 value。

要求返回字符串数组，就拿 ArrayList 存储。然后通过`result.toArray(new String[res.size()]);`进行转换。
